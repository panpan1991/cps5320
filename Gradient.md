### Gradient

Gradient is the largest directional derivative at a specific point.

Gradients at different points have different directions, because they take different directional derivatives at different points according to the length of those derivatives.

Example:
$$
\bigtriangledown f(x, y)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} i + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} j
$$
where $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} i $ and $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} j $ are directional derivatives on coordinates. On the direction of the summation of two vectors, the mode achieves the largest.

各个方向上的方向导数，来自两个坐标轴方向导数在该方向上的合力。在这些方向导数中，坐标轴方向导数之和所代表的方向，具有最大的导数值。
